		<p>
		I live at the end of a five-and-a-half-minute hallway<br>
		But as far as I can see, you are still miles from me<br>
		In your doorway<br>
		<br>
		And oh, by the way<br>
		When the landlord came today<br>
		He measured everything<br>
		I knew he'd get it wrong<br>
		But I just played along<br>
		'Cause I was hoping that would fix it all<br>
		<br>
		But there's only so far I can go<br>
		When you're living in a hallway that keeps growing<br>
		I think to myself<br>
		"Five more minutes and I'll be there"<br>
		<br>
		Inside your door<br>
		But there's more to this story<br>
		Than I've been letting on<br>
		There are words made of letters, unwritten<br>
		And yes, I forgive you for leading me on<br>
		<br>
		You can think of it like this<br>
		When you can't resist<br>
		I'm in your hallway standing on a cliff<br>
		And just when I think I find the trick<br>
		I'm tumbling, like an echo<br>
		<br>
		'Cause there's only so far I can go<br>
		When you're living in a hallway that keeps growing<br>
		I think to myself<br>
		"30 seconds and I'll be there"
